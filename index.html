			<p><b>What is the foreign exchange market (forex)?</b></p>
			<p>Have you ever travelled to a different country and exchanged money to the currency of your destination? Well you my friend, have influenced the markets by tiny amount and could be the reason of a trend reversal or even a continuation. See the concept of the foreign exchange market is quite simple, you buy price of the currency goes up or down you sell and either make a loss or a gain, or it could be the other way around, you can sell and buy later when the market has moved. The complicated bit lies in predicting how when and why the movement happens.</p>
			<p>The forex market is hugeee. $5 trillion switch hand’s every day. Yes, that’s a 5 with 12 0’s at the end with 4 commas.</p>

			<p>This is what the forex market looks like compared to the other markets like, New York Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, and London Stock Exchange.The forex market is OVER 200 TIMES BIGGER!!! Its so huge that us retail day traders are only 5% - 6% of the total volume of the markets or between $300million – $400million.</p>
			<p>The forex market is open 24 hours a day for 5 days a week closing for the weekend. I know what slackers am I right?</p>
